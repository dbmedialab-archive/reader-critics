## Temporary file dump while being in development

While features like _dynamically creating templates out of the database_ or
_build CSS out of an intermediate SASS that comes (again) from the database_
are not yet implemented, this directory serves as a temporary (hence the
name) file storage for **static requests** and modules that load things out
of these files instead of (yes, indeed) the database.

**Do not put anything into this directory that you expect to find back at
some point in the future. This will eventually be deleted completely.**
